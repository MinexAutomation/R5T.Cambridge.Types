R5T.Cambridge.Types - A types library for the Cambridge project.

Builds on work from:
https://github.com/MinexAutomation/R5T.Code.VS.SolutionFile.Types

# Goals

Build a simple, intuitive, easy way to de/serialize solution files and interact with their contents in memory.


# Discussion

This project takes the "refined" data-structure approach of parsing and structuring the information within the Visual Studio solution file.

This is partly because the solution file uses a custom text-based format (unlike a Visual Studio project file, which is really just an XML file). This means a "raw" approach would just be different groupings of (string) lines.

However, the "raw" approach is also harnessed to allow untyped solution-file global sections (global sections whose structure is not yet modeled in a "refined" data structure). This allows solution files with unknown global sections to still be de/serialized.
